## Description

There are A LOT of things to track when organizing a [Skate Canada CanSkate Program](https://skatecanada.ca/learn-to-skate/canskate/). Sessions, groups, skaters, badges, catagories, dates, etc. This web app aims to automate as many of the repetitive tasks as possible, allowing coaches to focus on what really matters: helping their students improve.
